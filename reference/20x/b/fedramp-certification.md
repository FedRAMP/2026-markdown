    Providers MUST supply machine-readable information in JSON documents that are valid against the corresponding JSON schema when a rule contains a FedRAMP JSON schema, UNLESS otherwise specified in the rule.

    ---

    _**Note:** This rule does not prevent a provider from seeking and maintaining a FedRAMP Rev5 Agency Certification and a FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering, however, doing so is strongly discouraged due to the increased complexity and risk of confusion for all parties._

    ---
    **Terms:** [Cloud Service Offering](../../../definitions/#cloud-service-offering){ data-preview }
## Applying for FedRAMP Certification {#applying-for-fedramp-certification}

### No Third-Party Applicants

??? abstract "FRC-APP-NTP"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-30:** Initial reset for the Consolidated Rules for 2026 Public Preview.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST NOT use a third party to apply for a FedRAMP Certification on their behalf; this includes independent assessment services.


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _FedRAMP previously allowed independent assessment services to submit applications on behalf of providers, but this caused confusion about who was responsible for the application and the information in it. Providers should apply directly to ensure clear accountability._
    - _Providers may use third parties to help them prepare their application and assessment materials for submission._
