# Changelog

## 2026.06.03.01-preview

**Release Date:** June 3, 2026

### Rules Changes

- **CDS-CSO-AVR** (formerly `CDS-CSO-PAR`): Renamed rule from "Public Availability Reporting" to "Availability Reporting". Rule ID changed from `CDS-CSO-PAR` to `CDS-CSO-AVR` to align with naming conventions. All class variants (a, b, c, d) retain their existing requirements and artifacts.
- **ICP-CSO-IIR** (Initial Incident Report): Clarified language across all class variants (a, b, c, d) to state that providers SHOULD/MUST provide information "as much of the following information that is available at the time of reporting and/or the current relevant status for each item". This addition applies to Classes A, B, C, and D statements.
- **ICP-CSO-OIR** (Ongoing Incident Reports): Clarified language across all class variants (a, b, c, d) to state that providers SHOULD/MUST provide "as much of the the following additional information that is available and/or the current relevant status for each item". This addition applies to Classes A, B, C, and D statements.


## 2026.05.31.01-preview

**Release Date:** May 31, 2026

### Rules Changes

The following changes were made in [pull request #12](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rules/pull/12) to the [FedRAMP Machine-Readable Rules](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rules) repository, which is used by this repository for machine-generated content:

- `FRD-FMV` adds the alternate term `fully mitigate vulnerabilities`.
- `FRD-PMV` adds the alternate term `partially mitigate vulnerabilities`.
- `FRD-RMV` adds the alternate term `remediate vulnerabilities`.
- `AGU-USE-NFC` is renamed from `Notify FedRAMP of Concerns` to `Notify FedRAMP of Monitoring Concerns`.
- `CCM-AGM-NFR` was removed from Continuous Collaborative Monitoring.
- `CCM-AGM-NPC` was removed from Continuous Collaborative Monitoring.
- `CCM-OCR-RPS` is renamed from `Responsible Public Sharing` to `Responsible Public Certification Report Sharing`.
- `CDS-CSO-RPS` is renamed from `Responsible Public Sharing` to `Responsible Public Package Sharing`.
- `CDS-TRC-HMR` is renamed from `Human and Machine-Readable` to `Human and Machine-Readable Certification Data`.
- `CDS-UTC-PGD` is renamed from `Public Guidance` to `Public Guidance for Certification Data`.
- `FRC-CLA-AFR` updates its following-information display reference for `CDS-UTC-PGD` to use `Public Guidance for Certification Data`.
- Structural: `FRC-CSF-PMV` moved from `FRR.FRC.data.rev5.CSF` to new rule `VDR-TFR-MVF` under `FRR.VDR.data.rev5.TFR`, preserving the Rev5 class-specific persistent machine verification and validation cadence.
- Structural: `FRC-CSX-PMV` moved from `FRR.FRC.data.20x.CSX` to new rule `VDR-TFR-MVX` under `FRR.VDR.data.20x.TFR`, preserving the 20x class-specific persistent machine verification and validation cadence.
- Structural: `FRC-CSO-NMV` moved from `FRR.FRC.data.all.CSO` to new rule `VDR-TFR-NMV` under `FRR.VDR.data.all.TFR`, preserving the non-machine verification and validation requirement.
- Structural: `FRC-CSO-FAV` moved from `FRR.FRC.data.all.CSO` to new rule `VDR-CSO-FAV` under `FRR.VDR.data.all.CSO`, with the statement narrowed to failures in vulnerability detection and response processes.
- `FRC-CSO-PVV` was removed as a standalone FRC rule; structurally, the persistent verification and validation concept is now incorporated into `VDR-CSO-DET`.
- `SCG-CSO-PUB` is renamed from `Public Guidance` to `Public Secure Configuration Guidance`.
- `SCN-CSO-HRM` is renamed from `Human and Machine-Readable` to `Human and Machine-Readable Notifications`.
- `VDR-CSO-DET` expands vulnerability detection to include penetration testing, incident response, automated control testing, and persistent verification and validation of information resources and processes.
- `VDR-CSO-FAV` adds the VDR rule requiring providers to treat problems or failures with vulnerability detection and response processes as vulnerabilities.
- `VDR-CSO-RES` converts a single note into expanded notes that distinguish partial mitigation, full mitigation, and remediation, and adds the corresponding FRD terms.
- `VDR-TFR-IRI` updates class-specific incident-treatment wording to use `Partially Mitigated Vulnerability` terminology for internet-reachable likely exploitable vulnerabilities at N3 or below.
- `VDR-TFR-NRI` updates class-specific incident-treatment wording to use `Partially Mitigated Vulnerability` terminology for non-internet-reachable likely exploitable vulnerabilities at N4 or below.
- `VDR-TFR-PVR` updates class-specific vulnerability response wording to use the defined partial mitigation, full mitigation, and remediation terms without changing the PAIN timeframes.

### Content Updates

- [Federal Agencies](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/agencies/): Clarified that agencies must follow FedRAMP processes when using cloud services and added an oversight warning with a March 2026 CIGIE cloud computing report link.
- [The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/responsibilities/): Added guidance for pointing AI services at FedRAMP source data and corrected the responsibilities link to the consolidated rules page.
- [Choosing a Certification Class](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/providers/start/class/): Replaced the placeholder with stable guidance on how Certification Classes scale by assurance, investment, federal process maturity, and agency use cases.
- [Choosing a Certification Type](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/providers/start/type/): Replaced the placeholder with stable guidance comparing 20x and Rev5, including when providers should use each option and how Rev5 is expected to be retired.
- [Choosing a Certification Path](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/providers/start/path/): Replaced the placeholder with stable guidance explaining Program Certification and Agency Certification, including which combinations are required, limited, or unavailable.

### Site Structure

- Replaced the multi-page FedRAMP responsibilities navigation with one [FedRAMP's Responsibilities](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/responsibilities/rules/) page that groups FedRAMP-specific rules in one place.

### Generated Page Experience

- Added support for generated FRR collection pages, allowing selected rules from multiple rulesets to appear together on one page. Example: [FedRAMP's Responsibilities](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/responsibilities/rules/).
- Updated the stable-status pictograph color to a darker green for better contrast and readability.

### Tooling

- Added generator tests and documentation for FRR collection pages, related-rule links, generated references, deadline output, and rendered page smoke checks.

## 2026.05.25.01-preview

**Release Date:** May 25, 2026

### Content Updates

- [Using the Consolidated Rules](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/rules/): Added a new overview page that explains how FedRAMP rulesets, subsets, rules, definitions, applicability, rule force, and rule identifiers fit together.
- [Getting Started as a Cloud Service Provider](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/providers/start/): Expanded the page with a step-by-step path for providers, from finding support through choosing a certification class, type, and path.
- [Getting Support](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/providers/support/): Added guidance on where providers should look for help, including documentation, public community channels, FedRAMP.gov updates, the help desk, and limits on what FedRAMP can do for private stakeholders.
- [Getting Support from FedRAMP](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/agencies/support/): Expanded the agency support page with direct contact guidance and links to the Agency Liaison Program, support groups, concern reporting, and CISA directive support.
- [Certification Classes](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/agencies/use/classes/): Added an explanation of how FedRAMP Certification classes differ from FIPS 199 security categories and how agencies should use that distinction in risk decisions.
- [Federal Agencies](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/agencies/): Updated the landing page cards so agencies are directed to the support page and the card labels read more consistently.
- [Advisory Services](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/advisors/): Removed internal source-document metadata without changing the public page text.

### Rules Changes

- A [significant number of underlying Rules changes were made on May 25 and earlier](https://github.com/FedRAMP/rules/pull/11).
- [Incident Communications Procedures](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/reference/incident-communications-procedures) were updated based on the outcome from RFC-0031.

### Site Structure

- Reorganized the overview navigation into clearer groups for understanding FedRAMP, preview information, and the complete ruleset reference.
- Added a [Complete Ruleset Reference](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/reference/) section with standalone generated pages for each ruleset.

### Generated Page Experience

- Added complete generated reference pages for each ruleset, with a reference index that lists ruleset status, subset counts, rule counts, and most recent update dates. Examples: [Complete Ruleset Reference](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/reference/) and [Incident Communications Procedures](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/reference/incident-communications-procedures/).
- Improved generated rule pages with subset navigation, activity workflow diagrams, PAIN timeframe tables, notes, following-information lists, source references, and links between related rules.
- Updated [FedRAMP Definitions](https://preview.fedramp.gov/2026/definitions/) so definitions render as one alphabetical list with an Important Related Terms table and links back to the relevant related-terms group.

### Tooling

- Updated the Markdown generation pipeline, templates, and tests for the new reference pages, definitions layout, workflow diagrams, related-rule links, and richer rule metadata.
- Improved build and deployment scripts, TypeScript checking, and documentation for generated page mappings.
- Updated the rules sync workflow so maintainers can sync the rules submodule from a named branch.

## 2026.05.17.01-preview

**Release Date:** May 17, 2026

- Moved Definitions from the FedRAMP section to the Overview section as they apply to all stakeholders.
- Added Cloud Service Providers -> Getting Started as a Cloud Service Provider -> [Finding an Advisor](providers/start/advisor)
- Added Cloud Service Providers -> Getting Started as a Cloud Service Provider -> [Finding an Assessor](providers/start/assessor)
- Added placeholder [FedRAMP Recognition for Independent Assessment Services rules](assessors/recognition/rules/fedramp-recognition.md)
- Lots of work continues behind the scenes

## 2026.05.04.01-preview

**Release Date:** May 4, 2026

This section contains a high-level summary of key takeaways:

- A consolidated annual rules model with expected support through December 31, 2028.
- FedRAMP Certification as the single official label for FedRAMP's outcome.
- Certification Classes A, B, C, and D replace previous FIPS-199 Security Categorization-based labels.
- Program Certification as an explicit path separate from Agency Certification.
- Rev5 Class A as a successor path connected to FedRAMP Ready transition.
- Marketplace rules for providers, assessors, advisors, and Preparation Phase listings.
- Agency Use rules.
- Class-specific timing and applicability throughout the structured rules.
- FedRAMP Certification Data, FedRAMP Certification Package, Ongoing Certification, Ongoing Certification Report, and Security Category definitions.
- Explicit artifacts in structured rules.
- Empty placeholders for Independent Assessment Plan, Independent Assessment Report, and Security Decision Record rules.
- Rev5 Balance Improvement Releases shift from optional or beta materials into staged mandatory CR26 rules.
- The role of assessors shifts toward verification and validation of processes and outcomes, not just review of static documents.
- Continuous monitoring shifts from monthly artifact-heavy submissions toward shared 3-month reporting and quarterly review patterns.
- Vulnerability management shifts toward contextual vulnerability detection and response, including exploitability, internet reachability, and potential adverse impact.
- Significant change handling shifts from requests to notification rules with change categories.
- Minimum Assessment Scope reduces reliance on a single traditional Authorization Boundary Diagram.
- Key Security Indicators shift to outcome language and a smaller set of indicators.
- Agency responsibilities become more explicit and machine-readable.
- "Authorization" terminology changes to "Certification" terminology when referring to FedRAMP's action.
- "Authorization Data Sharing" changes to "Certification Data Sharing".
- "Ongoing Authorization Report" changes to "Ongoing Certification Report".

### 20x moves from pilot materials toward formal rules

The 20x pilot model becomes part of the same consolidated rule structure.

- The count of Key Security Indicators has been reduced from 60 indicators to 46 indicators.
- The separate old "Authorization by FedRAMP" Key Security Indicator domain is removed. Those items are now handled as FedRAMP Certification rules and rule-set cross-references instead of security indicators.
- Key Security Indicators were broadly rewritten from imperative statements into outcome-style statements. Most retained indicators keep the same intent with clearer, more consistent statement shape.
    - **Old style**: "Securely manage the lifecycle and privileges..."
    - **New style**: "The lifecycle and privileges... are securely managed..."

Stakeholders should not confuse the small number of Key Security Indicators for a small number of rules - there are 150+ overall rules, in addition to the Key Security Indicators, that apply to cloud service providers seeking FedRAMP Certification.

### Specific Key Security Indicator Changes

 The meaningful removals and consolidations are:

#### Removed Key Security Indicator domain

The **Authorization by FedRAMP** Key Security Indicator domain was removed. These 10 indicators no longer appear as Key Security Indicators:

- `KSI-AFR-ADS` Authorization Data Sharing
- `KSI-AFR-CCM` Collaborative Continuous Monitoring
- `KSI-AFR-FSI` FedRAMP Security Inbox
- `KSI-AFR-ICP` Incident Communications Procedures
- `KSI-AFR-MAS` Minimum Assessment Scope
- `KSI-AFR-PVA` Persistent Validation and Assessment
- `KSI-AFR-SCG` Secure Configuration Guide
- `KSI-AFR-SCN` Significant Change Notifications
- `KSI-AFR-UCM` Using Cryptographic Modules
- `KSI-AFR-VDR` Vulnerability Detection and Response

These are now better represented as FedRAMP Certification rules and rule-set obligations.

#### Consolidated cybersecurity education indicators

The old Cybersecurity Education domain had 4 indicators:

- `KSI-CED-RGT` Reviewing General Training
- `KSI-CED-RST` Reviewing Role-Specific Training
- `KSI-CED-DET` Reviewing Development and Engineering Training
- `KSI-CED-RRT` Reviewing Response and Recovery Training

The new domain has 1 indicator, consolidating the same training themes into a single broader outcome.:

- `KSI-CED-RAT` Reviewing All Training.

#### Removed standalone phishing-resistant multifactor authentication indicator

The old standalone `KSI-IAM-MFA` phishing-resistant multifactor authentication indicator was removed. The remaining Identity and Access Management indicator for passwordless methods now includes strong passwords with phishing-resistant multifactor authentication when passwordless methods are not feasible.

### Still in Progress

The following areas should not be treated as fully settled in the current preview:

- FedRAMP Certification rules are still being built out as formal rules.
- Marketplace Listing rules are still being built out as formal rules.
- Incident Communications Procedures rules are pending the outcome of RFC-0031.
- Using Cryptographic Modules rules are still being built out as formal rules.
- Agency Use rules are still going through review.
- Independent Assessment Plan rules are empty.
- Independent Assessment Report rules are empty.
- Security Decision Record rules are empty.
- Many narrative pages in the 2026 Markdown corpus are empty or incomplete.
- Some machine-generated sections still need tuning or have not yet been converted into the structured rules file.

#### Monitoring TO DO

A complete summary of the status of all pages based on their own metadata is available on the [TO DO](todo.md) page.
